# c_state_machine
A simple state machine implemented in C. 

Added a new improved variant in statemachine.c. This is just as proof of concept. 
There is still much room for improvement, but you should get the idea if you read through the source code.

Old deprecated variant was was taken from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1371460/state-machines-tutorials/1371654#1371654.  
I just finished it, so it can be tested and maybe used for a real project.  

There is no license, as this simple example is not worth it.
