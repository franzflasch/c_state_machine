# c_state_machine
A simple state machine implemented in C. 

The code was taken from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1371460/state-machines-tutorials/1371654#1371654.  
I just finished it, so it can be tested and maybe used for a real project.  

There is no license, as this simple example is not worth it.
